![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) 

A C++ practice project where I built the classic game **Pong** from scratch. This project highlights my understanding of **object-oriented programming, game loop design, collision detection, and basic physics implementation** in C++.

**Key features implemented:**
- Paddle and ball mechanics with smooth movement
- Collision detection and ball reflection
- TODO: Score tracking and game reset logic
- Console-based rendering using 2D vectors
